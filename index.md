# &emsp;Implementing Circularity with &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Plants and Computers

_Circular_ _Flow_ _Design_ is the emerging scientific discipline developed on this page. It emerges from the need of modern society to tackle three problems of global scale: climate change, pollution, and the dependence on finite reserves of materials.  

_Circular_ _Flow_ _Design_ results from the intersection of the following 6 research topics:
